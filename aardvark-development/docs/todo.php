	  (module) Visual Verrification / CAPTCHA @ subscribe form

	  (cleanup) SWITCH "phase1" dialogs of subscriber add/delete/search/export to INLINE DISPLAY vs. AJAX POLL 
 			+ Requires unobtrusive modal window (thickbox destroys event bindings). Keep eye on Gavin's plugin
 			+  scratch Gavin's -- use jQmodal ! (mine)
 		 
	  (API) include some kind of bandwith throttling / DOS detection / firewalling to drop pages from offending IPs / halt system for 3 mins if too many page requests ??
	  (API) Plugin architecture -- allow handler & manipulation injections/replacements to API functions
	  	+ Can be used to chain the subscription process (process.php) through custom functions, add an extended authentication layer, etc.
	  
	  Phase out pommo->init('keep') and data->set || -> get routines. Use States & auto clear states

	  FIREWALL/DOS PROTECTION: Mailer, only allow x amount of mails from an IP in y time.

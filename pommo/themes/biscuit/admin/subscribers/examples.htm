<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>For example, if you collect &quot;AGE&quot; and &quot;COUNTRY&quot; as subscriber fields, you can match those who are 21+ and living in Japan by creating two rules; one which matches &quot;AGE&quot; to greater than 20, and another which matches &quot;Japan&quot; to &quot;COUNTRY&quot;. Including or excluding members of other groups is possible. </p>

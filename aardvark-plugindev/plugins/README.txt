 VERY BETA!!!
 
 - php DLL Libraries die gebraucht werden.
 - Abhängigkeiten 
 - WIKI
 
 
 
 
 In order to enable plugins:
 
 -	Enable plugins in the config.php file in the poMMo root.
 	//TODO config file was changed
 	Set the value $useplugins = TRUE;
 	MAYBE put this in the pommo CLASS $pommo->_useplugins = TRUE;
 	IN inc/classes/pommo.php!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 	// TODO REVISION mechanism from single user pommo
 
 -	Generate TABLES in the database with the script:
 	yourpommourl/plugins/installplugins.php
 	It contains some basic configurations. To edit the configurations use the pluginmanager plugin.
 	All configs should be editeble through the database.
 	
 
 There are some constraints -> e.g. the authentication plugins
 Maybe some constraints will be added in the future.

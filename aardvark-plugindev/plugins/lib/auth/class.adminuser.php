/*
 * Having a separate Admin class makes sense: (linux way)
 * - there should only be this authentification with the config values,
 * 	so that in case someone corrupts the authentication plugin
 * 	the "real" administrator can always reset the authentication methods 
 * 	to the intended method. You could not login into the system anymore if
 *  the auth goes only through the user management system
 * - You can define other administrators as well with the user functionality
 * 	with all the necessary rights/permissions.
 *  If these permissions are somehow corrupted you have the option to reset 
 *  them with to the intended state through this separated Admin class because 
 *  the admin has always all privileges and these are not checked when you log 
 *  on with the config admin. 
 * - OR ldap server hangs/is broken and you don't reach pommo anymore
 * - This is some kind of linux style root user, whitch is a common way.
